# calender
- This is a basic text-based clock program written in C.
- It allows you to set the initial time (hours, minutes, and seconds) when you start the program.
- The clock continuously updates and displays the time in a 12-hour format (AM/PM) with a one-second delay between each update.
- The program clears the console screen to provide a dynamic clock display.
- It validates the user's input for hours (1-12), minutes (0-59), and seconds (0-59) and handles errors gracefully.
- The user can exit the program manually by closing the console window.
- The clock uses the Windows API's **`Sleep`** function for timing.
- It's a simple example of a text-based clock and can be a fun and educational project for learning C programming.
